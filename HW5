Q1: T-test
Q2: The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics. It states that, regardless of the population's distribution, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases. It is important because it allows us to make statistical inferences about population parameters and perform various hypothesis tests using the normal distribution, which simplifies statistical analysis and makes it more widely applicable.
Q3. Statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false. It measures the ability of a statistical test to detect a real effect or difference if it exists. High statistical power is desirable because it reduces the risk of a Type II error (failing to detect a true effect) and increases the chances of finding statistically significant results when they are present.
Q4. Randomly assign subjects or participants to different groups or conditions. This helps minimize selection bias and ensures that each group is comparable in terms of both known and unknown factors. Randomization is commonly used in experimental studies.
Q5: Confounding variables, also known as confounders, are extraneous factors or variables in a research study that can distort the apparent relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. 
Q6: A/B testing is to measure and compare the outcomes or behaviors of the two groups to determine whether the changes made to the "B" group had a statistically significant and meaningful impact compared to the "A" group. 
Q7: Confidence intervals (CIs) are a statistical concept used to quantify the uncertainty or variability associated with an estimate or parameter in a sample. A confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to fall, with a certain level of confidence.
